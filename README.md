# MovieNight üçø

MovieNight is my React Native learning project developed for Reactseals academy. 

This app uses [TheMovieDb API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to get information about all the latest and greatest movies. You can discover popular entries from each genre or just search for the movie you like. Click on a picture to see a detailed info about a movie including it's **Rating** , **Description** and **Trailer**

## Installation / Usage

Download the **MovieNight.apk** file from the repository and run it on your Android device.

Or alternatively you can run the project using the [Expo client](https://expo.io/) 

*(requires Expo client install on your Android device)*

```bash
npm install --global expo-cli
cd ...path_to_project/movieapp
expo start
```
